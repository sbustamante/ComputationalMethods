    "From calculus we know that Taylor polynomials expand a function at a specific point $x_i$, being both functions (the original one and the Taylor function) exactly equal at any derivative-order at that point. Also, as mentioned before, a Lagrange polynomial, given a set of data points, passes through all those points at the same time. However if those points come from an unknown underlying function $f(x)$, the interpolant polynomial might (surely) differ from the real function at any superior derivative-order. So we have:\n",

If we assume two different polynomials to fit each set of data, i.e. a polynomial for $\\{f(x_i)\\}_i$ and another for $\\{f'(x_i)\\}_i$, we obtain $2n+2$ coefficients, however zeroth-order coefficients can be put together so finally there are $2n+1$ independet coefficients to be determined. In this case, we assign the respective Hermite polynimial as $H_{2n+1}(x)$."
