    "Linear Algebra is a discipline where vector spaces and linear mapping between them are studied. In physics and astronomy, several phenomena can be readily written in terms of linear variables, what makes Computational Linear Algebra a very important topic to be covered throughout this course. We shall cover linear systems of equations, techniques for calculating inverses and determinants and factorization methods.\n",

    "An interesting fact of Computational Linear Algebra is that it does not comprises numerical approaches as most of the methods are exact. The usage of a computer is then necessary because of the large number of calculations rather than the non-soluble nature of the problems. Numerical errors come then from round-off approximations."
