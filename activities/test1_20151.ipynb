      "There is an increasing interest in studying rocky exoplanets due to the large amount of new discoveries, including recently earth-size planets. Modelling the internal properties of these planets is then prior to understanding them and to set posible theoretical constraints. In this activity we are going to use root finding and interpolation techniques to explore a set of simulated profiles of earth-size rocky planets produced using the software [PLYNET](https://github.com/facom/Plynet/tree/1.0-release)."

Finally, write a new routine called **MeanDensityLaw** that, given any planetary mass (even a value not provided in the data), and with the previous values of mean density and radius of mean density, returns the radius where the mean density would be reached. For this you need to perform an interpolation (Linear or Lagrange) again. Plot your results."
