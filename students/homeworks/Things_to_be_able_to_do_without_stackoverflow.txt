INTERPOLATION
what are the methods of interpolation							spline, hermite, Lagrange polynomial
which one is most common								spline
how does spline work									piecewice interpolation for each pair... etc

DIFFERENTIATION 
what is the geometrical interpretation of derivative					slope
how to find derivative using Python							from scipy.misc import derivative
											derivative(y,x)
what scheme uses Python scipy.misc.derivative and why					central difference


INTEGRATION
what is the geometrical interpretation of integration (simplyfied)			area under the curve
how to calcualte integral using Python							import scipy.integrate as integrage
											integrate.quad(fun...)
what are the schemes for the numerical integration					trapezoid, Simpson, Quad

how can one estimate numerical integral using Monte Carlo Method			acceptance-rejection, mean value method
what are the advantages and disadvantages of Monte Carlo Method				slower and less precise for simple integrals (quad is better)
											but can be useful for highdimensional complex integrals
